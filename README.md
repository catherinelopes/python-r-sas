Welcome to Data <em>Data Science Using Python, SAS, &amp; R: A Rosetta Stone for Analytical Languages</em>.  This tutorial includes examples of common data science tasks, organized in the same way across 3 data science languages.  Before beginning this tutoiral please check to make sure you have an updated version of Python, SAS, and/or R installed.  Python 3.5.2, R 3.3.1, SAS 14.2 (SAS/STAT 14.2, SAS/ETS 14.2, SAS/OR 14.2, SAS/IML 14.2, SAS/QC 14.2), and SAS Enterprise Miner Workstation 14.2 were used to generate these results, so if you have different versions your code will not run successively, or it will result in slightly different results.

To the extent possible, all three tutorials follow the same progression and can be compared by example number.  The tutorials also include extensive helpful links to the documentation for the programming languages. All data used in these examples is included in this folder as well.  Finally, there are several Python &amp; R packages that need to be installed in order to go through the tutorial successfully.

Python: <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas (0.20.2)</a>, <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy (1.12.1)</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html">Matplotlib.PyPlot</a>, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seaborn (0.7.1)</a>, <a href=https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#module-re>re (2.2.1)</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html">decimal (1.70)</a>, <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sklearn (0.18.2)</a>, <a href="http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html">statsmodels.api</a>, <a href="http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html">xgboost (0.6)</a>, <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/pyclustering/">pyclustering</a>, <a href="http://www.pyflux.com/docs/">PyFlux (0.4.15)</a>, <a href="https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api">FBProphet</a>

--- I used pip install ____ or conda install ____ where appropriate.

R: gdata, rjson, ggplot2, dplyr, tree, randomForest, gbm, xgboost, e1071, RSNNS, caret, kernlab, dbscan, forecast

--- I used install.packages("name_of_package")

In order to run the SAS tutorial successfully, you will need Base SAS, SAS Enterprise Miner, and access within SAS to call R in order to execute R code.  For more information on calling R code within SAS please see [this post](https://communities.sas.com/t5/General-SAS-Programming/Run-R-code-inside-SAS-easily/td-p/210116).

Happy programming and analyzing!
